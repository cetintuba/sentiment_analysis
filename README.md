This project contains a **Sentiment Analysis (Yorum Analizi)** workflow implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to classify user comments as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**, using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

---

## Overview

The notebook `Yorum_Analizi.ipynb` demonstrates how to:

* Load and preprocess text data
* Clean comments (lowercase, remove punctuation, stopwords, etc.)
* Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF
* Train machine learning classifiers
* Evaluate model accuracy
* Predict sentiment for new comments

This project is suitable for beginners and intermediate learners in data science.
